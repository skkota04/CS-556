# CS-556 Queueing Simulations

This repository contains Java implementations for various queueing system simulations. Each simulation explores different aspects of system performance under varied conditions.

## Java Simulation Files

- **[Q3.java]**  
  Implements a coffee shop simulation that processes 500 customer arrivals over 1000 simulation runs. It calculates metrics such as:
  - Average waiting time
  - Average system time
  - Utilization factor and idle time fraction
  - Average queue length and maximum queue length  
  Additionally, it compares the simulation outcomes with theoretical values.

- **[Q2.java]**  
  Conducts a capacity analysis where the system has a finite capacity. Over 1000 simulation runs and a fixed simulation time, it evaluates:
  - Average waiting time and system time
  - Utilization rate
  - Average queue length
  - Probability of the system being full
  - Rejection probability when capacity is reached

- **[Q1.java]**  
  Simulates a system with a varying number of active servers during different periods of the day:
  - 0-2 hours: 2 servers
  - 2-5 hours: 4 servers
  - 5-8 hours: 3 servers  
  It computes period-specific performance metrics including:
  - Average waiting time and system time
  - Server utilization
  - Average queue length
  - Probability that all servers are busy

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile:**  
   Use the following command in your terminal:
